# Solar Challenge Week 1

## Overview
This project analyzes and compares solar energy data from Benin, Togo, and Sierra Leone. The goal is to clean, explore, and compare solar potential across these countries using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains EDA and comparison notebooks.
- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned data (not committed to git).
- `src/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`: Project code and tests.
- `.github/`: GitHub Actions workflows for CI.

## How to Run
1. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:
   - Windows: `python -m venv venv`
   - Mac/Linux: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
5. Open and run the notebooks in order.

## Progress
- [x] Data cleaning and EDA for each country
- [x] Cross-country comparison
- [ ] Further statistical analysis and visualization improvements
