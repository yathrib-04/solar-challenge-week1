# Solar Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes solar data from Benin, focusing on various aspects of solar panel performance, environmental conditions, and their relationships. The analysis is structured in a modular, object-oriented manner to ensure maintainability and reusability.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Inspection**: Efficient loading and initial analysis of solar data
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analysis of solar irradiance and temperature patterns
- **Outlier Detection**: Identification of anomalies in key measurements
- **Cleaning Impact Analysis**: Assessment of panel cleaning effects on performance
- **Wind Analysis**: Wind rose plots and wind pattern analysis
- **Temperature and Humidity Analysis**: Study of environmental effects on performance

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yathrib-04/solar-challenge-week1.git
cd solar-challenge-week1
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open `notebooks/benin_eda.ipynb` to run the analysis

## Code Organization
The project follows a modular, object-oriented design:

### DataLoader Class
- Handles data loading and initial inspection
- Provides basic dataset information and statistics
- Manages data validation and preprocessing

### DataAnalyzer Class
- Performs various analyses on the solar data
- Includes methods for outlier detection, time series analysis
- Handles correlation analysis and environmental impact studies

### Visualizer Class
- Creates various visualizations of the analysis results
- Supports time series plots, correlation heatmaps
- Generates wind rose plots and environmental relationship charts

## Progress Documentation
### Week 1
- Implemented basic data loading and inspection
- Created modular analysis framework
- Developed initial visualizations
- Established project structure and documentation

### Next Steps
- Implement additional analysis methods
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Enhance visualization capabilities
- Add unit tests for core functionality
